------ SOLUTION :

On Linux or macOS:
+ Open a terminal.
+ Use a text editor with superuser privileges to edit the file. For example:
========= " sudo nano /etc/hosts  "

+ Add the following line to map the hostname mongo to localhost:
    ====  " 127.0.0.1 mongo "

+ Save the file and exit the editor (in nano, you can do this by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, and Enter).

On Windows:
+ Open Notepad as an administrator. You can do this by searching for Notepad in the Start menu, right-clicking it, and selecting “Run as administrator”.
+ Open the hosts file located at " C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts. "
Add the following line to map the hostname mongo to localhost:
======   " 127.0.0.1 mongo "

+ Save the file and close Notepad.
+ After updating the /etc/hosts file, try running your application again to see if the issue is resolved. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
